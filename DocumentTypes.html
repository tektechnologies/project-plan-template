			<h2>Document Types Reference</h2>
			<p>The following are standards for various document types used for software design.  A typical document name will begin with the two-letter type prefix, underscore, project name, underscore, and document name.  For example, a Use Case document to describe the user printing in a project called Example would have a name of <kbd>UC_Example_User_Prints.doc</kbd></p>
